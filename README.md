recipes
=======

This repo is a location for recipes I've come across and details about my preferred cooking techniques. It is intended to be accessible to people with little to no cooking knowledge, and useful to people who are experienced.

I am very much an amateur, but I enjoy cooking and sharing my knowledge. As a result, much of what is here is just my opinion, which is almost always wrong. I'm ok with that. However, I also appreciate constructive criticism and pull requests!

My comments on cooking techniques not specific to any certain recipe are in the `general` directory.

I post pictures of interesting things I make (or would like to make) [on Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/longb4/food/).
