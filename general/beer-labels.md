Beer labels
===========

The Bottles
-----------
I use 22oz bottles with thick walls designed for homebrewers. You can use smaller bottles or commercial 22oz bottles with thinner walls, but the larger size is less annoying to fill and cap, and thicker walls reduce the risk of bottles exploding or shattering.

The Design
----------
I use InDesign for making label designs. Always try to use vector (or at least very high-resolution raster) images. Keep in mind that the label will be on a curved surface, so focal graphics or text ought to have their width slightly less than the diameter of the bottle.

For a 22oz bottle, I use 8in x 4in labels and have InDesign export PDFs with about 1/4in of bleed on the edges of the design -- if I were just printing a solid color, for example, I would get a PDF of an 8.5in x 4.5in rectangle with crop marks at the corners telling me where to cut it to get 8in x 4in. The advantage of this is that you can be less precise as you cut the labels and the overprinting produces a much cleaner-looking (and perhaps durable) result.

Putting ABV and capacity on the label is a good idea for your own convenience. I'm assuming you're not distributing or selling your beer -- if you are, there's a whole host of regulations and hurdles you have to handle regarding what you can, cannot, and must put on a label.

Printing
--------
I get my labels laser-printed from Staples on regular paper. Regardless of where you get yours, I strongly recommend laser printing because the toner holds up to water (think condensation and coolers) far, far better than inkjet, and the color quality tends to be much more consistent.

Cutting
-------
This is where you'll come to appreciate bleed and crop marks. If you don't have a paper cutter (either guillotine style or rotary style), try to borrow one before resorting to scissors.

Labeling bottles
----------------
Always label dry, clean, room-temperature bottles or the labels will not stay on. After cutting out labels, simply use a glue stick to cover the back of a label (or at least the corners, edges, and part of the middle), wrap it around a bottle, and press firmly until it's stuck on.

You may want to give the labeled bottle an hour or two before refrigerating to make sure it's stuck on well. Either way, the label should hold up very well to refrigerating and moderately well to being in an ice-filled cooler. If your design is basically all solid color rather than mostly blank paper, the toner may make the label slightly more water-resistant.

Removing labels
---------------
If you save your bottles to use again for your next brew, the labels are easy to remove. Just run the labeled bottle under hot water for a minute or so to loosen up the glue, then slowly peel it off in a single piece starting from one end. Rinse any remaining glue, then wash and sanitize the bottle before filling with the next batch.
