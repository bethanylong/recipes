Stir-frying
===========

I am an unabashed heretic. Ask me to saute something and I'm more likely to pull out a wok than a traditional frying pan or skillet. There are plenty of subtle differences between sauteing and stir-frying, none of which I've grasped, and my take on stir-frying is probably as far from authentic as it gets. That being said, I enjoy stir-frying, and it's among my most commonly-used nontrivial techniques.

The Wok
-------
A wok, or at least a large frying pan with appreciably-high sides, is necessary for any stir-frying. Woks provide enough depth to keep your carrots from flying out, landing under the burner cooking your rice, and setting off the smoke alarm, and the sloping edges help you set up a subtle heat gradient for pieces of food that need more heat or less heat.

Traditionally, woks are made of steel or cast iron with no non-stick coating, since the Teflon breaks down into a critically-panned (haha) seasoning at extreme high heat. The electric burners I use aren't at risk of reaching those temperatures under typical use, so I have a non-stick wok.

Versatility
-----------
Before I get into the intricacies of stir-frying, it's worth mentioning that it can be used to make huge, complex dishes where the stir-frying is the main attraction, or it can be used as a complement to simpler dishes. I frequently fry up small things like bell peppers, zucchini, and garlic just to toss with some angel hair and olive oil, for instance. For what it's worth, that combination could be turned into a half-decent (albeit fragile) chow mein by adding the angel hair to the wok and stir-frying it all up with some soy sauce and sesame oil.

Preparation
-----------
Stir-frying happens fast, and it needs your full attention. Don't try to chop up that last clove of garlic just as your vegetables go into the wok. Prepare *all* your ingredients beforehand so you aren't scrambling to pay full attention to the wok that's threatening to burn dinner and the knife with a serious case of bloodlust at the same time.

Ingredient Shape and Size
-------------------------
Most ingredients (with some exceptions. like pasta) should be chopped small enough to not be overwhelmed by a finger-sized chunk of carrot when you take a bite, but not so small that they lose their texture and ease of gripping with chopsticks. Julienning, or chopping ingredients like carrots into matchstick-sized pieces, is an extremely common method.

Ideal size does depend on whether you're using something substantial like ~~spaghetti~~ yakisoba or something granular like rice.

Oil
---
Hot oil is the primary route through which stir-fried ingredients get their heat, rather than from being in direct contact with the wok surface. Always heat up the wok and oil before adding the first ingredients. Sometimes, especially when getting familiar with a new stove, I put a couple pieces of onion or carrot into the wok as it heats, and as they start sizzling, I can gauge how hot the oil is getting.

Without enough oil, your food will probably burn (or at least won't cook properly), but too much will make everything soggy and gross. I typically start with around 2 tablespoons of oil, though I always just eyeball it. Experiment with what works best for you.

Use a neutral, high-smoke-point oil like peanut oil or possibly canola oil when stir-frying. Not only is olive oil rarely the level of quality advertised on the bottle, but it's also expensive (even when it's less virginal than it claims) and has a distinct flavor that doesn't go well with most stir-fried dishes. As always, there are exceptions; if you're like me and stir-fry your ratatouille, using some olive oil can be justified.

Heat
----
Proper heat is one of the most vital components of a successful stir-frying experience, and also unfortunately the most variable between stoves. Heat level is typically in the ballpark of high or medium-high. I've used a smoothtop electric stove that was happiest around 90% power, a gas range that consistently burned my food above 70% power, and a coil cooktop that stir-fries best around 80% power.

One of the best indicators that you've found the sweet spot, given that your food is both not burning and showing signs of cooking, is sizzling. Generally, keeping everything sizzling is a good goal. If things stop sizzling, that may be an indicator of heat being too low or needing to add more oil. With experience, you'll grow to recognize the different sizzling sounds made by water-based and oil-based ingredients.

Movement
--------
It isn't called *stir*-frying for nothing! Use your implement of choice to make sure everything keeps moving in order to prevent burning and make sure heat gets distributed evenly. If you find yourself stir-frying at 60% power on an electric stove and the results are disappointing, consider increasing the heat, since the food can tolerate it with more motion.

Wok Congestion
--------------
Don't get the wok too full, or it'll be unable to effectively heat everything well. If the ingredients get deeper than an inch or so (depending on how dense they are), you'll end up steaming everything, and it will likely just get soggy rather than fried. This can be mitigated to some extent with good movement.

Cooking order
-------------
While every recipe is different, a common pattern tends to emerge among stir-frying recipes pertaining to the order in which you add ingredients. Getting familiar with this order is a great foundation for improvisation.

The amount of time to stay at each stage varies depending on what you're cooking, but it's typically wise to not move on until the current stage is at least hot, if not fully cooked. Keep in mind that ingredients added earlier in the process will have lots of time to keep cooking as later ingredients get cooked. Also remember to use the shape of the wok to your advantage; if some ingredients are getting too well-done too early, keep them toward the edges. Just don't forget them, or they'll burn!

* **Oil**
* **Meat or tofu** (if any)
* **Tough vegetables** like celery, carrots, onions, and broccoli
* **Tender vegetables** like bok choy, bell peppers, and mushrooms
* **Noodles or rice** (if any)
  * Keep in mind that noodles and rice are cooked in water, and you'll need to cook off much of this moisture before moving on to prevent sogginess.
  * I've tried using barley, lentils, and couscous (not all at once) at this step with interesting results. Be creative.
* **Sauces** like soy sauce and pad thai sauce
  * Many watery sauces will need to be reduced before moving on.
* **Aromatics** like garlic, ginger, and green onions
  * This is a good point to add sesame oil for a flavor and scent that isn't overwhelming.
* **Garnish** like peanuts and cilantro

So, here's an example of something you could come up with:
* Peanut oil (~2 TB)
* Broccoli (~1 cup, chopped, or about half a crown)
* Bell peppers (~1 cup, chopped or cut into strips, or one bell pepper)
* Fresh (refrigerated) udon noodles
* Soy sauce (1/4 cup) with maybe a bit of sugar (1/2 TB), or the sauce packet that comes with the udon and however much water it needs
* Green onions (~1/3 cup, chopped, or about one stalk)

Be creative and experiment with amounts and combinations of ingredients.
