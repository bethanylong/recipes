Cheese Soup
===========

Yield: dip for 4 people, or soup for 1-2 people

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 TB butter
* 2 TB flour
* 1/4 onion, diced well
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/4 cup vegetable stock
* 1/2 cup dank, flowery IPA (such as Luggage Rack)
* 1/4 cup whole milk
* 1-2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/8 lb (4 oz) sharp or extra-sharp white cheddar, grated
* 2 tsp sugar
* Salt
* Pepper

Directions
----------
1. Heat butter in saucepan over medium heat. When butter begins to bubble, add onion and saute until softened and reduced, 4-5 min. Add garlic and cook until happily aromatic, 1-2 min.
2. Add 1 cup stock and the milk and IPA; bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk together flour and remaining cold stock in a small dish to remove clumps. Once saucepan contents are simmering, gradually add flour mixture while stirring, to desired thickness. (You can always add more later.)
3. Stir in paprika, cumin, and sugar. The paprika should produce a lovely golden-orange color in the soup. Blend saucepan contents until smooth, with an immersion blender if available.
4. Gradually add cheese while stirring to smoothly melt it in.
5. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Notes
-----

Based on the Garlic, Cheddar, and Stone Ruination IPA Soup recipe from The Craft of Stone Brewing Co.

Consider keeping some extra flour, stock, and paprika on hand. If it's too thin, add more of the stock-flour mixture; too thick, add more stock; too pale, add more paprika.

The original recipe calls for roasted garlic in addition to fresh garlic. Consider adding about half a head to one head of roasted garlic if you're a fan. My own research is forthcoming.

Keep an eye on your soup thickness, especially if you're letting it simmer for more than ~15 minutes. If you're happy with the thickness, don't be afraid to put a lid on the saucepan to prevent losing moisture.
