Veggie Burgers
==============

This recipe represents the culmination of my quest to no longer pay exorbitant amounts for mediocre veggie burgers at the grocery store. These black bean burgers are cheap, easy, and delicious.

Yield: 4 burgers

Bake: 375Â°F

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 can (16 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
* 1/2 bell pepper (your choice of color)
* 1/2 medium onion, about 1/2 cup
* 1/4 cup shredded or matchstick carrots
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup bread crumbs

Seasonings:
* 1 TB garlic powder
* 1/2 TB chili powder
* 1/2 TB smoked paprika
* 1 ts cumin
* 1/2 ts black pepper

Directions
----------
1. In a bowl, mash beans well with a fork until beans are pasty and none are intact.
2. Finely dice bell pepper, onion, and carrots and mix into beans.
3. In a different bowl, beat egg and mix in seasonings. Stir egg mixture into bean mixture.
4. Stir bread crumbs gradually into bean mixture. At this point, make sure the components of the mixture are evenly distributed.
5. Divide bean mixture equally into four parts. Roll each part into a **very** (this is important) well-packed ball.
6. Place the balls onto a cookie sheet and press them down until they're about 3/4 inch tall. The edges will probably crack or split -- re-shape them firmly. The edges are most prone to falling apart, so doing this will make things much more pleasant later on.
7. Bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
8. Serve fresh out of the oven, or freeze for later reheating in a frying pan with some cooking spray or olive oil.
