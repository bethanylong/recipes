Vegetables and Pasta
====================

I struggled to come up with an accurate name for this recipe. Suffice it to say this is a super hearty and satisfying dish that borders on stew-like. Try as I might, I haven't managed to get tired of it yet. It also reheats incredibly well in the microwave.

Yield: about 4 servings

Ingredients
-----------
- 1/3 lb dried farfalle pasta
- 1/2 large onion, chopped
- 1 medium zucchini, chopped
- 1/2 medium eggplant, chopped (about 2 cups)
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 4 crimini or white mushrooms, chopped
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 24 oz can pasta sauce
- 3-4 TB olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

Directions
----------
1. Cook farfalle according to package directions. Drain in colander when done.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet or wok. Add onions and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until softened and slightly browned, about 5 minutes.
3. Add zucchini and eggplant to pan and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
4. Add bell pepper and mushrooms and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
5. Add garlic and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.
