Heirloom Sugar Cookies
======================

This is an old family recipe from my late great-grandmother Marie. The original (and admittedly unappealing) name is "Marie's Ashtray Cookies" because they are traditionally flattened with a (clean) ashtray that has ridges on the bottom in the shape of a snowflake. The snowflake design then appears on the top of each cookie.
