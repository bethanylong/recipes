==================

(Makes great breadsticks too!)

Yield: 2-3 pizzas or 16 breadsticks

Bake: 375-400Â°F

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 1/8 cups warm water

* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 2 TB sugar
* 1 TB garlic seasoning (preferably Johnny's)
* 1/2 TB salt
* 2 tsp active dry yeast
* Butter (optional, for breadsticks)

Directions
----------
1. Combine all ingredients in bread machine on dough setting, or knead well in a large bowl, cover, and let rise.
  * Add additional water or flour (~1 TB) if the dough is too dry or too sticky, respectively.
2. Use plenty of flour to divide and roll out dough for pizza or breadsticks.
3. __For pizza__: Poke holes in crust with a fork and bake 3-4 minutes before adding sauce and toppings. After toppings, bake for 10-15 minutes, watching for bubbling cheese and golden crust.
