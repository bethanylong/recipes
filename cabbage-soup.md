Cabbage Soup
============

I swear this stuff is the cure for the common cold.

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 TB olive oil
- 1/2 onion, diced well
- 3 ribs celery, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
- 1 (14.5 oz) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes, diced
- 2 quarts vegetable or chicken-flavor broth
- 1 ts salt (or to taste)
- 1/2 ts black pepper (or to taste)
- 2 ts Italian seasoning mix (or oregano and basil)

Directions
----------
(Optional) Saute all vegetables and seasonings in olive oil for 5-10 minutes. Start with the garlic and onion, then as they soften, gradually incorporate the rest.

Heat in crock pot on low for 6-8 hours, or on high for 4 hours, or on the stovetop for 1 hour.
