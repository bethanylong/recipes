Spent Grain Dough
=================

Yield: 16-24 rolls, 4 pizza crusts, or any number of zany bread creations

Bake: 375Â°F

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 1/4 cups warm water (hint: yeast like the same temperatures you do)
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 Tbsp active dry yeast
* 1 to 3 cups fresh spent grains (fresh from the mash tun, or frozen and thawed)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup milk or whipping cream
* 4 to 5 cups flour

Directions
----------
1. Beat egg in a small bowl. Set aside.
2. In mixing bowl, combine water, sugar, and yeast. Allow yeast to activate and start foaming (15-30 minutes).
3. Add spent grains, salt, beaten egg, and milk, and mix well.
4. Slowly add flour, mixing as you go.
5. Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled. After this, it's fine to cover and refrigerate for a few days.
6. About an hour before baking, knead dough and divide as desired. Bake 30-35 minutes for rolls or as needed for other recipes.
